[Task statement]

Before answering, think through this carefully:
<thinking>

[What it should do after the edit — be specific]

Scope:
Only modify [function / component / section].
Do NOT touch: [list everything to leave unchanged]

Constraints:
- Language/framework: [specify version]
- Do not add dependencies not in [package.json / requirements.txt]
- Preserve existing [type signatures / API contracts / variable names]

Done When:
[Exact condition that confirms the change worked correctly]
```

## Template H — ReAct + Stop Conditions
[REQ] Autonomous agents (Claude Code, Devin). Prevents runaway loops.
```
Objective:
[Single, unambiguous goal in one sentence]

Starting State:
[Current file structure / codebase state / environment]

Target State:
[What should exist when the agent is done]

Forbidden Actions:
- Do NOT modify files outside [directory/scope]
- Do NOT run the dev server or deploy
- Do NOT push to git
- Do NOT delete files without showing a diff first
- Do NOT make architecture decisions without human approval

Stop Conditions:
Pause and ask for human review when:
- A file would be permanently deleted
- A new external service or API needs to be integrated
- Two valid implementation paths exist and the choice affects architecture
- An error cannot be resolved in 2 attempts
- The task requires changes outside the stated scope

Checkpoints:
After each major step, output: ✅ [what was completed]
At the end, output a full summary of every file changed.
```

## Template I — Visual Descriptor

POSITIVE PROMPT:
[subject], [style], [mood], [lighting], [composition], [quality boosters: highly detailed, sharp focus, 8k]

NEGATIVE PROMPT:
[what to exclude: blurry, low quality, watermark, extra limbs, bad anatomy, distorted, oversaturated]

CHECKPOINT: [model name]
SAMPLER: Euler a (recommended starting point)
CFG SCALE: 7 (increase for stricter prompt adherence)
STEPS: 20-30

## Template M — Opus 4.7 Task Brief

[What needs to be built, fixed, or produced — one clear sentence. Add WHY if it affects approach.]

## Context
[What exists now — relevant files, current behavior, stack already in place, what was tried and failed]

## Target State
[What done looks like — specific files changed, behavior produced, tests passing. Binary where possible.]

## Scope
- Work only in: [specific files and directories]
- Do NOT touch: [forbidden files — .env, package-lock.json, configs, anything outside scope]

## Constraints
- [Stack version, naming conventions, no new dependencies without asking]
- Only make changes directly requested. Do not add features, abstractions, or files beyond what was asked.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Binary check 1]

## Template N — Phased Execution

```
Objective: [Describe the overarching goal of the large project]

To ensure high quality and prevent loss of focus, we will execute this project in [X] distinct phases.

Phase 1: [Description of the first phase, e.g., Planning and Outline]
Phase 2: [Description of the second phase, e.g., Core Structure / Draft]

CRITICAL RULE:
You must ONLY execute Phase 1 right now. Do NOT begin Phase 2 or any subsequent phase.
When you finish Phase 1, stop and ask: "Is this phase approved, or do you need changes before we move to Phase 2?"
```
