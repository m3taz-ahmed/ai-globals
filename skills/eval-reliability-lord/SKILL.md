# Eval Reliability Lord

[OBJ] Correct reliability scoring for AI coding agents. pass@k is misapplied — reliability@k is the fix.

## Problem

Current AI coding agent benchmarks rank with the pass@k estimator but misapply it: they set n = number of unit tests in a single submission rather than n = independent rollout attempts. This conflates test-suite size with attempt independence, inflating reported scores by 0.85–0.97 in absolute terms (0.96–0.98 reported vs 0.00–0.12 corrected).

## Rules

1. [REQ] **n = independent rollouts.** reliability@k uses n = number of independent rollout attempts per (task, agent) pair. NOT test-suite size.
2. [REQ] **c = fully-passing rollouts.** c = rollouts where ALL tests pass. Partial pass = fail.
3. [REQ] **Formula.** `reliability@k = 1 - C(n-c, k) / C(n, k)`. When n < k, use `c/n`. When n == 0, return 0.0. Clamp to [0, 1].
4. [REQ] **Security-adjusted.** `security_adjusted_reliability@k` counts only rollouts that are BOTH functionally correct AND free of high-severity insecure patterns. A rollout that passes tests but has a critical vuln = SECURITY_FAIL, not PASS.
5. [REQ] **Multi-rollout mandatory.** Single-rollout scores are NOT reliability. A cheap single-rollout proxy fails to substitute (Spearman ρ = 0.417). Minimum 5 rollouts for a reliability score.
6. [REQ] **Report both.** Every eval report must include reliability@k AND security_adjusted_reliability@k. Reporting only one = incomplete.
7. [REQ] **Docker reproducibility.** Rollouts must run in isolated, deterministic Docker containers (SWE-bench pattern). Flaky local deps = invalid score.
8. [REQ] **Task-level resolution.** Report per-task resolution, not just macro-averaged pass rate. Macro-averaged hidden-test pass rate (0.80) diverges sharply from strict task resolution (0.20).
9. [REQ] **No recall contamination.** Tasks mined from public GitHub merges may have been seen during pretraining. Prefer original tasks (DeepSWE pattern) whose reference solutions stay out of the public record.
10. [REQ] **Verifier quality.** Inherited tests from merged PRs fail correct alternatives or pass incomplete fixes. Use hand-written verifiers that accept any correct implementation.
11. [REQ] **Score band separation.** A good benchmark separates frontier agents across a wide score band. Clustering at 95%+ = benchmark saturation, not agent excellence.
12. [REQ] **Cost-aware.** Report tokens + duration per rollout. Reliability without cost = misleading. A 99% reliable agent at 10x cost may be worse than 90% at 1x.
13. [REQ] **Rollout independence.** Rollouts must be independent: different seeds, fresh context, no shared state. Shared context = correlated failures = inflated score.
14. [REQ] **aiZee eval harness.** Use `eval/reliability.py` for scoring. `eval/harness.py` for end-to-end evidence gates. Never hand-compute reliability.
15. [PROHIBIT] Reporting pass@k as reliability without n = independent rollouts.
16. [PROHIBIT] Counting a rollout with a high-severity vuln as PASS for security-adjusted scoring.
17. [PROHIBIT] Single-rollout "reliability" claims.
18. [PROHIBIT] Using inherited PR tests as the sole verifier without checking they accept correct alternatives.
