[SKILL] freelance-platforms
[OBJ] Operate as a high-performing freelancer on global and Arabic marketplaces. Find the right jobs, score opportunities, craft winning proposals, negotiate, deliver, and get paid — while staying safe, compliant, and in control.

[DOMAINS]
- Global: Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer.com, Toptal, Guru, PeoplePerHour.
- Arabic: Mostaql, Khamsat, Nabbesh, Bawaba, Qawm.

[CMD] Context7 IDs:
- Upwork GraphQL API: `websites/upwork_developer_graphql_api`
- Upwork Node OAuth2 SDK: `upwork/node-upwork-oauth2`
- Freelancer.com API: `websites/developers_freelancer`

[RULES]
1. [REQ] Orientation: default to freelancer mode unless the user explicitly says they are a client hiring talent.
2. [REQ] Two operating modes:
   - ADVISORY: strategy, research, profile/proposal drafts, pricing, client analysis. No credentials required.
   - AUTOMATION: requires an MCP server + valid OAuth token. Every write action (bid, message, profile update, contract action) requires an explicit `yes` from the user before execution.
3. [CMD] MCP servers (configured in `.devin/mcp_config.json` + `aios_mcp/config.json` + AIOS plugins in `plugins/`):
   - Upwork: `npx -y @furkankoykiran/upwork-mcp` (GraphQL, official API). Required env: `UPWORK_CLIENT_ID`, `UPWORK_CLIENT_SECRET`. Run `npx -y @furkankoykiran/upwork-mcp auth` first. AIOS plugin: `plugins/upwork/` exposes 8 tools (search_jobs, get_job_details, get_profile, list_contracts, get_balance, list_saved_jobs, save_job, get_proposal_stats).
   - Freelancer.com: `npx -y freelancer-mcp-server` (official API). Required env: `FREELANCER_OAUTH_TOKEN` (or `FREELANCER_ACCOUNTS` JSON for multi-account). AIOS plugin: `plugins/freelancer/` exposes 11 tools (search_projects, get_project, my_projects, my_bids, place_bid, get_milestones, list_threads, get_messages, send_message, get_self, list_accounts).
   - Fiverr: `uvx fiverr-mcp-server` (Python/PyPI, no API key, scraper-based). READ-ONLY: search_gigs, get_gig_details, get_seller_profile, get_gig_reviews, list_categories. [PROHIBIT] Use only for market research; never for automated bidding or messaging (violates Fiverr ToS). AIOS plugin: `plugins/fiverr/` exposes 5 read-only tools.
   - Context7: `npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp` (library docs). Required by `mcp.mdc` rule for external library/framework code. AIOS plugin: `plugins/context7/` exposes 2 tools (resolve_library_id, get_library_docs).
4. [REQ] Security: store tokens in environment variables or `.devin/mcp_config.local.json`, never in committed files, prompts, logs, or skill output. Rotate tokens if exposed.
5. [REQ] Profile optimization:
   - Title: niche + specialization + measurable promise.
   - Overview: hook → credibility → process → CTA. Keep under platform limits.
   - Skills: map to in-demand categories, no stuffing.
   - Portfolio: 3-5 case studies with problem, role, tech/tools, and quantified result.
6. [REQ] Job scoring (0-100): fit to niche, client quality (verified payment/history/spend), budget realism, competition density, description clarity. Reject jobs below a user-defined threshold and explain why.
7. [REQ] Job search:
   - Prefer MCP when configured.
   - Otherwise build a search strategy with filters, save results in a markdown shortlist table (title, platform, budget, score, link, action).
8. [REQ] Proposals:
   - Hook from the job description.
   - Proof: 1-3 relevant outcomes.
   - Process: 3-5 high-level steps.
   - Pricing: 2-3 packages or a single clear bid.
   - CTA: specific next step.
   - Delegate final copy refinement to `proposal-writer` when pure copy quality is the main ask.
9. [REQ] Bidding automation:
   - Draft the bid/proposal in a temporary note for review.
   - [PROHIBIT] Submit any bid without user approval and a valid token.
   - After approval, record proposal ID, platform, client, bid, and deadline in memory.
10. [REQ] Client communication:
    - Draft concise, professional messages. Confirm tone before sending.
    - [PROHIBIT] Send messages on the user’s behalf without explicit approval.
11. [REQ] Contracts and milestones:
    - Record start date, milestones, payment terms, deliverables.
    - Use platform payment protection (Upwork Payment Protection, Freelancer Milestones, Mostaql escrow).
12. [REQ] Platform-specific notes:
    - Upwork: connects, Job Success Score, Top Rated, hourly vs fixed, payment protection, 5-20% fee.
    - Fiverr: gig tiers, packages, response time, seller levels, 20% fee, no public API.
    - Freelancer.com: bids, milestone payments, identity verification, 10% fee.
    - Mostaql: escrow, per-project, Arabic/English, verification badge.
    - Khamsat: micro-gigs ($5-25), response time matters.
    - Nabbesh: corporate/enterprise oriented.
13. [REQ] Scam avoidance: no work without a contract/milestone, no off-platform payment, no upfront bank transfers, no fake client links, no "test" work without pay.
14. [REQ] Fees and pricing: always factor in platform fees and currency conversion. Show net earnings after fees when quoting.
15. [REQ] Output format: markdown tables for job shortlists, checklists for profile/proposal tasks, structured bullet sections for strategy.
16. [REQ] Fallback: if MCP is not configured, provide copy-paste-ready actions and CLI commands for the user to run manually.
17. [REQ] Memory: after each bid, contract, or client interaction, store key facts via `ai-os memory add` or `workflows/17-memory-sync.md`.
18. [REQ] Continuous improvement: track win rate, average bid value, and response time. Suggest profile/proposal adjustments based on data.

[PROHIBIT]
1. No bid, message, contract, profile update, or withdrawal without explicit user approval.
2. No use of scraped Fiverr data for bidding or messaging.
3. No storing credentials, tokens, client passwords, or PII in code, logs, prompts, or commits.
4. No generic spam proposals; every bid must be tailored to the job description.
5. No sharing client PII outside the platform or the user’s approved systems.
