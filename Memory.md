[NOTES]
- Session: full project audit + MCP review + fixes.
- Found root-path mismatch: rules say `D:\server\.ai` but actual root is `D:\.ai`. Set `AGENT_OS_ROOT=D:\.ai` as permanent User env var. Rules text still references old path (cosmetic; config.discover_root() falls back correctly).
- Found `state/MEMORY.md` missing and `state/` gitignored — all rules reference it. Workaround: `Memory.md` at root is the actual file used. Recommend updating rules to point at `Memory.md`.
- `query_rules` MCP tool was substring-only and returned `[]` for "kernel policy". Upgraded to FTS5 via MemoryStore (kind=semantic, filtered to rules/) with substring fallback. File: `aios_mcp/aios_server.py`.
- Removed inline `import asyncio` in `aios_server.py:run_mcp_plan` (violated no-inline-import rule). Moved to top-level import.
- `temp/` was 28,808 files / 447 MB — cleared completely per user approval.
- MCP servers verified working: `ai-global-os` (18+ tools) + `graphify` (10 tools + 6 resources). `graph_stats`: 1879 nodes / 3224 edges / 276 communities / 93% EXTRACTED.
- Quality gates green: ruff ✅, mypy ✅ (45 files), pytest ✅ (412 passed, 91% cov), eval/harness ✅ all_pass.
- Open issues (not fixed, need decision): `adapters.py` has 3 stub adapters (Codex/ClaudeCode/RemoteA2A); `check_policy` defaults to `ask` for reads; `get_os_status` returns empty `tech_stack`; 44 untracked + 30 modified files in git.

- Expanded *-lord skills to 11 domains (database, language, cloud-platforms, devops, frontend-frameworks, backend-frameworks, messaging-streaming, search-vector, ai-ml, linux-systems, security) and compressed them to Telegraphic Pseudo-Code.
- Fixed `runtime/tech_stack.py` version detection: matches hyphenated major-minor tech-stack filenames, parses `composer.json`/`package.json` constraints when lockfiles absent, and aliases common packages.
- Fixed `Dockerfile` `state/CHANGELOG.md` COPY bug; now creates `state/`/`brain/`/`graphify-out/` directories.
- Refreshed `graphify-out/` graph.
- Refactored `dashboard/server.py`: shared kernel/memory instances, configurable CORS origin, per-IP rate limiting, POST body validation.
- Refactored `runtime/mcp_client.py` to cache stdio processes per server/root and reuse initialized stdio connections.
- Updated `workflows/README.md` file count and added 11-14 audit workflows.
- Added `runtime/policies/examples/` (api-rate-limits, data-exfiltration, time-based-access) and recursive policy loading.
- Pinned `.github/workflows/ci.yml` action SHAs (actions/checkout, actions/setup-python) and documented SBOM/Cosign release step.
- Quality gates green: ruff, mypy, pytest, `python eval/harness.py`.
- Integrated 9 AI personas into `global-roles.md` (English) and created `global-roles-ar.md` (Arabic) for agent/IDE identity charters.
- Rewrote `README.md` and `README-AR.md` with clearer quickstart, persona showcase, updated architecture, and bilingual links.
- Implemented Auto Persona Selection: `runtime/persona.py` + integration in `runtime/kernel.py`, `runtime/workflow.py`, `cli.py`, and tests.
- Added `ai-os persona list/detect` and `ai-os agent spawn --persona auto`.
- Added persona skills `game-architect`, `google-play-warlord`, `mobile-game-producer` with Context7 IDs and `PERSONA_SKILLS` mapping.
- Fixed CI/CD: `graphify.yml` installs `graphifyy` and creates a PR; `ci.yml`/`validate.yml` use pinned SHAs + lighter `[dev]` install + `--no-cov`.
